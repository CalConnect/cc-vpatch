== Introduction

The iCalendar <<RFC5545>> data format is in widespread use to represent calendar data. iCalendar data can
grow large (e.g., a family calendar containing events over a period of several years). Updating
large resources over the network currently requires the entire data to be sent - even if the
change itself is minor.

This specification defines a new iCalendar component that can be used to "patch" (incrementally
update) iCalendar data in an efficient manner. When combined with the HTTP PATCH method <<RFC5789>>, it can
be used to update calendar object resources on a CalDAV <<RFC4791>> server, or any resource on an HTTP
server that contains iCalendar data.
