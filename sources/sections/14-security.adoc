== Security Considerations

Patch processing engines MUST ensure that the result of applying a patch is a
valid iCalendar object in the context of the application using the calendar
data. At the very least, the resulting iCalendar object MUST comply with the
requirements of <<RFC5545>>.

Security considerations described in <<RFC5545>>, <<RFC5789>>, and <<RFC4791>>
MUST be adhered to.
