This document defines a new iCalendar <<RFC5545>> component that allows small "patches" to be applied to
large iCalendar data objects, to allow for efficient data updates. It also describes how this
new component can be used with the CalDAV calendar data access protocol <<RFC4791>>.

[NOTE,title=Open Issues]
====
* Do we need/want to handle individual values in multi-valued properties/parameters?
* What media type do we advertise in `Accept-Patch` header? Just `text/calendar`? Currently using `text/calendar; component=VPATCH; optinfo=PATCH-VERSION:1`
